# rock-paper-scissor
This is my first self-made project. A simple game of rock, paper, scissors. HTML, CSS, JS files all created by me. It's a start.. :)

How To Play:
1. Click on your choice of weapon and see if you beat the computer!
2. Your scores are recorded and displayed to show how lucky or not lucky you have been.
